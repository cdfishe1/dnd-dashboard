Whatever this thing is that haunts you can&rsquo;t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><strong><span>Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Choose&nbsp;two of Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Languages:</span></strong>&nbsp;Choose one exotic language (Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon)</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Equipment:</span></strong>&nbsp;Monster hunter&rsquo;s pack (see sidebar), one trinket of special significance (choose one or roll on the Gothic Trinkets table in this&nbsp;appendix)</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>MONSTER HUNTER'S PACK</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can buy a monster hunter&rsquo;s pack for 33 gp, which is cheaper than buying the items in it individually.

Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.</p>\r\n<h5>Harrowing Event</h5>\r\n<p>Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape.

If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>",

See <span style=\"color:#9c0\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#936\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the cleric spell list.</p>\r\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the <span>Cleric table.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish<span> a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have<span> spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span>cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of pre<span>pared spells.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell <span>on your list.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the sp<span>ell prepared.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your c<span>leric spells.</span></p>",

Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the g<span>uild&rsquo;s coffers.</span></p>\r\n<p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild.

Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop.

You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn&rsquo;t stand on its own&mdash;it&rsquo;s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don&rsquo;t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family&rsquo;s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\r\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\r\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;History, Persuasion</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</dt>\r\n</dl>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Variant Noble: Knight</h5>\r\n<p>A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span>you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash; in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could<span> be your bond.)</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>VARIANT FEATURE: RETAINERS</strong></p>\r\n<p>If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.</p>\r\n<p>You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds&mdash;responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family&rsquo;s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.</p>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d8</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>I don&rsquo;t like to get my hands dirty, and I won&rsquo;t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk.
